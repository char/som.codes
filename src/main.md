Hi there. I write software, basically: I work with low-level JVM stuff for work, and in my free time, I reverse engineer games and write cheats.

Currently, the project that takes up the majority of my time is a Java bytecode obfuscator, so I have become extremely familiar with JVM bytecode.

Also find me on <a href="https://github.com/char/" rel="me">GitHub</a>.

## Languages

I also like to learn natural languages.

- **English** is my native language and the one I use the most.
- **French** is a language that I spoke while growing up, since both my parents are francophones.
- I took five years of **Spanish** at school and consider myself conversationally adept.
- I have been teaching myself **Korean** since mid-2016, and consider myself an intermediate speaker.
- I know the Cyrillic alphabet, but I only speak enough **Russian** for baseline communication with teammates in games.
